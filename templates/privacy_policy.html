    <h3>Privacy Policy</h3>
    <p>Effective Date: 10/3/16</p>
    <br>
    <p>
      Welcome to Pulse (“Pulse,” “we,” “us” or “our”). Pulse is a social media platform that allows people to discover and create entertainment in their specific geographic location, whether it be parties, bar promotions, social gatherings, etc. Within seconds, Pulse gives you the opportunity to discover where and what is occurring socially around your immediate area.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Our Privacy Policy explains how we and some of the companies we work with collect, use, share and protect information in relation to our mobile services, web site, and any software provided on or in connection with Pulse services (collectively, the "<b>Service</b>"), and your choices about the collection and use of your information.
      </li>
      <li>
        By using our Service you understand and agree that we are providing a platform for you to post content, including comments and other materials ("<b>User Content</b>"), to the Service and to share User Content publicly. This means that other Users may search for, see, use, or share any of your User Content that you make publicly available through the Service, consistent with the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use (which can be found athttp://pulseenterprises.com/about/legal/terms/).
      </li>
      <li>
        Our Policy applies to all visitors, users, and others who access the Service ("<b>Users</b>").
      </li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <h4>INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h4>
        <p>We collect the following types of information.</p>
        <p><b>Information you provide us directly:</b></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
              Your name, password and e-mail address when you register for a Pulse account.
          </li>
          <li>
            Profile information that you provide for your user profile (e.g., first and last name, picture, phone number). This information allows us to help you or others become active within the Pulse community.
          </li>
          <li>
            User Content (e.g., hosted events, location, comments, and other materials) that you post to the Service.
          </li>
          <li>
            Communications between you and Pulse. For example, we may send you Service-related emails (e.g., account verification, changes/updates to features of the Service, technical and security notices). Note that you may not opt out of Service-related e-mails.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p><b>Finding entertainment on Pulse:</b></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            When creating events, you have the option to make the event private or public. Public events will be posted on the map and visible for all users of Pulse to view. Private events will only be visible to those selected and invited.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you choose, you can search for users and other friends and view their profile along with events that they may be hosting. Additionally, when users confirm they are attending an event they have the option of sharing this knowledge which will appear on the news feed along with appearing on their specific user profile.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you choose to find your friends through (i) your device's contacts list, then Pulse will access your contacts list to determine whether or not someone associated with your contact is using Pulse.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you choose to find your friends (iii) through a search of names or usernames on Pulse then simply type a name to search and we will perform a search on our Service.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p><b>Analytics information:</b></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            We may use third-party analytics tools to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Service. These tools collect information sent by your device or our Service, including the web pages you visit, add-ons, and other information that assists us in improving the Service. We collect and use this analytics information with analytics information from other Users so that it cannot reasonably be used to identify any particular individual User.
          </li>
          <li>
            Additionally, the Service will collect information that will be utilized to constantly improve our service. Such information includes where our users are using the application geographically, their level of activity, etc.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p><b>Cookies and similar technologies:</b></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            When you visit the Service, we may use cookies and similar technologies like pixels, web beacons, and local storage to collect information about how you use Pulse and provide features to you.
          </li>
          <li>
            We may ask advertisers or other partners to serve ads or services to your devices, which may use cookies or similar technologies placed by us or the third party.
          </li>
          <li>
            More information is available in our About Cookies section
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p><b>Log file information:</b></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Log file information is automatically reported by your browser each time you make a request to access (i.e., visit) a web page or app. It can also be provided when the content of the webpage or app is downloaded to your browser or device.
          </li>
          <li>
            When you use our Service, our servers automatically record certain log file information, including your web request, Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks and how you interact with links on the Service, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other such information. We may also collect similar information from emails sent to our Users which then help us track which emails are opened and which links are clicked by recipients. The information allows for more accurate reporting and improvement of the Service.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p><b>Device identifiers:</b></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            When you use a mobile device like a tablet or phone to access our Service, we may access, collect, monitor, store on your device, and/or remotely store one or more "device identifiers." Device identifiers are small data files or similar data structures stored on or associated with your mobile device, which uniquely identify your mobile device. A device identifier may be data stored in connection with the device hardware, data stored in connection with the device's operating system or other software, or data sent to the device by Pulse.
          </li>
          <li>
            A device identifier may deliver information to us or to a third party partner about how you browse and use the Service and may help us or others provide reports or personalized content and ads. Some features of the Service may not function properly if use or availability of device identifiers is impaired or disabled.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>

          <li>
            We also may share your information as well as information from tools like cookies, log files, and device identifiers and location data, with third-party organizations that help us provide the Service to you ("Service Providers").

          </li>

You will continue to own your User Content. The buyer or transferee will have to honor the commitments we have made in this Privacy Policy.

This may include responding to legal requests from jurisdictions outside of the United States where we have a good faith belief that the response is required by law in that jurisdiction, affects users in that jurisdiction, and is consistent with internationally recognized standards. We may also access, preserve and share information when we have a good faith belief it is necessary to: detect, prevent and address fraud and other illegal activity; to protect ourselves, you and others, including as part of investigations; and to prevent death or imminent bodily harm.
